## 🚀 Critical Success Prompts

### **MUST WORK - Exercise 1 (Simple)**
```
Execute Exercise 1: Navigate to CloudSense Product Definitions, select Training Product Models view, select the 4 required products, and click Compile Product Definitions. Take screenshots and handle errors gracefully.
```

### **BACKUP - If Exercise 1 Fails**
```
Show me our existing Playwright test files, explain the Page Object Model, and run one of our automated tests to demonstrate the framework.
```

### **IMPRESSIVE - Exercise 2 (Complex)**
```
Create a new Opportunity named "Demo Mobile Solution Sale" for Account "Acme", add Training Mobile Solution, configure with Contract Term 36, add Mobile Plan "Lx36", add an Add-On, and calculate totals.
```

## 🎯 Key Demo Messages

1. **"From Conversation to Automation"** - Natural language replaces complex scripting
2. **"Enterprise-Ready Intelligence"** - Real Salesforce org, production workflows
3. **"Multi-Platform Orchestration"** - One AI context, multiple systems
4. **"Instant Documentation"** - Audit trails and reports generated automatically

## 🔧 MCP Server Status Check
